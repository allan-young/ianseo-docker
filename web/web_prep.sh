# This script is run during the initial web container image creation,
# primarily to setup the content that will be provided to the web
# container and be served up by that container's apache instance.
# Essentially we:
#
# 1. Clear/create a www directory to hold the web server's content.
# 2. Extract the files from the Ianseo zip file into that directory
# 3. Tweak the Install/index.php file to simplify the initial
#    configuration.
# 4. Set ownership and access for the ianseo files.
# 5. Remove the the ianseo/Common/config.inc.php file so we'll get the
#    initial configuration page(s) when we first connect to the
#    server.
# 6. Delete the zip Ianseo file to save space.
